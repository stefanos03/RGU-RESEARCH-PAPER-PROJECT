                This project will be designing to implement a web application that will help group project to upload, identification, review, monitoring and following of research papers between the group members. The research activities will be report writing, review, editing and other similar tasks can be to monitor and track the editorial progress of a number of papers within a limited time. Furthermore, this project will give the opportunity for the user to create platform that will support group project teams.
                <br/><br/>
                In this system they will be three types of users: Administrator, Student Team Leader and Students. All users will have access to the register system i.e. members will be required to log in. The administrator has the highest role to manage the tools on the platform, and he will only has the access to create users, setup project groups, allocate team leader role and assign members to the project. The team leader is responsible for delivering papers to members for review and. Students will be able to upload research papers, this will be submitted to the Student team leader, who will allocate it to any members for review.

                <ol>
                    <li> 2.1 The web application must be hosted on a server with up-to-date code stored in Github:
                        <ol type='a'>
                            <br>
                            <li>The application will be hosted on a local server (csdm-webdev) accessible to all interested parties for use inside the University.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li> All codes will be available on github at <a href="https://github.com/stefanos03/PROJECT-RESEARCH-PAPER-SHARING-APP" target="_blank">https://github.com/stefanos03/PROJECT-RESEARCH-PAPER-SHARING-APP</a>.

                            <br>
                            <li>The front-end is the presentation layer that the user will use to perform tasks on the web app. The front-end is the user-friendly Graphical User Interface built. It is built using HTML, CSS, Font awesome and Bootstrap.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>The back-end is the logic and data layer. It executes user's requests, by performing query based on the request and return response to the user on the front-end.</li>
