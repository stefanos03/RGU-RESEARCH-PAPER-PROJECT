     Dear Sir,

                  INAPROPRIATE PLACEMENT ON PROMOTION SCALE
  
    I write with reference to the   (memo reference) of th	e recent 2014 promotion exercise, I wish to appeal for a review of the  placement from CONTISS 7/5 to CONTISS 8/1 instead of CONTISS 8/2.

    This is my first promotion since 2009 when I joined the service of the University. I was due for promotion in 2012 but was denied on the ground of resuming two weeks short of the promotion year. Also in the 2013, when i should I have been given I was denied for some uncommunicated reasons. I was already in CONTISS 7/5 before the ratification of the promotion and I belive that I should be given CONTISS 8/2.

   Sir, I hereby passionately appeal that this be reviewed considering my long years of service.
   Thank you sir in anticipation of a favourab	le response.
